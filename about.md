Oh, goodness, you want to know about me? 

I spent Christmas Day 1984, at the age of 6, typing in programs to our brand new ZX Spectrum+. I still remember the Stars and Stripes rendered in glorious 256x192. I've come a long way since then, except I still get the same buzz from making code work. Alas, I don't get to copy it out of a book these days.

I write code, I delete code, I manage teams, I like talking at other people. These days, Kotlin is my go-to language, but there are real systems in use by actual people that have Java, Ruby, Python, C++, VBA and COBOL written by me, to varying extents and degrees of success. To be fair, some of them should probably be taken down by now.

My mum still doesn't understand what I actually do.
